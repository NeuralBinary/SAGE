"""Regression tests for GitHub issue #11.

The MCP SDK's ``StreamableHTTPSessionManager.run()`` may only be entered once
per FastMCP instance. SAGE therefore builds a fresh FastMCP on every lifespan
startup (see ``src/sage_plugin/main.py``: the ``lifespan`` context manager and
the delegating ``_MCPMount`` at ``/mcp``), so repeated app startups in a
single process — e.g. one ``TestClient`` per test — no longer raise
``RuntimeError: StreamableHTTPSessionManager .run() can only be called once
per instance``.
