"""Held-out scenario fixture for the sealed evaluation harness (issue #22, stage 3).

This module is the UNSEEN conversation for ``--held-out`` mode: a NEW project
("Orion") that the codebook-establishment phase has never seen, structured in
parallel to the RFC Phoenix fixture so the same deterministic scoring machinery
(``compression_benchmark``'s ``read_state`` / ``evaluate_turn`` /
``ground_truth_answers`` / ``fidelity_critical``) applies unchanged.

Phases (mirrors the RFC Phoenix fixture but with distinct names and facts;
the compiled establishment canonicals are NOT all distinct from Phoenix --
2 of the 5 are shared: '12' (the bare number split out of "Python 3.12.")
and 'database_migrations_must_be_reviewed_by_the_platform_team' (the
generic migration-review sentence kept verbatim for the fidelity checker);
the held-out UPDATE canonicals are fully disjoint from Phoenix):

* Phase 1 -- establishment: ``ESTABLISHMENT_SHARED_CONTEXT`` is transmitted
  once.  In held-out mode this is the ONLY material the SAGE variants'
  FROZEN codebook is compiled from (see ``establishment_canonicals``); the
  held-out updates below are deliberately NOT part of it.
* Phase 2 -- five held-out updates (``HELDOUT_UPDATES[0:5]``) mutate the
  project state; ``HELDOUT_STATE_DICTS`` tracks the state after each one
  (turn 0 = establishment state, turns 1-5 = after updates 1-5) and
  ``HELDOUT_CHANGE_MARKERS`` carries the per-turn "what changed" markers.
* Phase 3 -- the downstream task is scored against the embedded ground-truth
  answer key exactly as in the standard scenario.

Content-type coverage (issue #22 section C): the fixture contains at least one
update per required content type, each tagged in a comment below:

  1. paraphrased concept      -- U1 restates the deploy gate / failure in new
                                 words ("cannot deploy until the suite is
                                 green" style, not the establishment sentence);
  2. unseen value             -- U2 introduces Python 3.13, a value never seen
                                 during establishment (3.12 was);
  3. new combination of known concepts -- U3 composes billing service +
                                 Commerce team + integration tests + platform
                                 team + migration review in a NEW relation;
  4. changed state            -- U4 flips ``failed_tests`` 3 -> 1;
  5. contradiction            -- U5 approves the migration DESPITE the
                                 remaining test failure (failure vs approval);
  6. negation                 -- U6 negates a fact ("No ... failures");
  7. numeric constraint       -- U7 pins a deploy gate threshold ("at least
                                 80 percent ... to pass");
  8. delayed-relevance        -- U8 plants a fact that only matters later
                                 ("will require ... later this year").

The harness machinery is frozen at six turns (turn 0 = shared context, turns
1-5 = updates), so ``HELDOUT_STATE_DICTS``/``HELDOUT_CHANGE_MARKERS`` cover the
first five updates; updates 6-8 complete the content-type coverage of the
fixture itself (the FROZEN-CODEBOOK-PROOF and coverage tests compile every
update).

The module is fully embedded and deterministic: constants only, no RNG, no
timestamps, no external files, and ``sage_plugin`` is NEVER imported at module
import time (``establishment_canonicals`` imports the compiler lazily so the
fixture stays importable before ``SAGE_DATABASE_URL`` is bound).
