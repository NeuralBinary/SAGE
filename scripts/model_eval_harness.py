"""Opt-in model evaluation harness (issue #16, stage 3).

This script runs the stage-2 compression benchmark's receivers on real model
runtimes through external adapter commands, measuring COLD and WARM receivers
separately.  It is opt-in: with no ``--adapters`` config (or when
``SAGE_BENCH_LLM_PROVIDER`` is unset) it prints ``not run, no provider`` and
exits 0 -- provider numbers are never fabricated (mirroring
``scripts/compression_benchmark.py`` and ``scripts/model_matrix_benchmark.py``).

Design
------
A NEW script that REUSES the stage-2 benchmark
(``scripts/compression_benchmark.py``) instead of mutating it.  The stage-2
benchmark stays byte-deterministic and its determinism tests pass unchanged;
the harness loads it as a module (same importlib pattern the tests use) and
consumes its deterministic per-variant per-turn records (wire bytes,
reconstructions), its scenario fixture (``SHARED_CONTEXT``/``UPDATES``/
``STATE_DICTS``/``CHANGE_MARKERS``), its ground-truth answer key
(``ground_truth_answers``) and its deterministic token estimator.  The
harness itself never calls a model and never fabricates results: every
``task_success``/token/cost figure comes from the adapter's JSON reply.

Adapter convention (mirrors ``scripts/model_matrix_benchmark.py``)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
An adapters JSON config maps ``model_identity -> spec``::

    {
      "acme-gpt-4o": {
        "family": "acme",
        "version": "gpt-4o-2026-05",
        "codebook_version": "global:1",      # optional, default "global:1"
        "command": ["python", "-c", "..."]   # argv; JSON on stdin, JSON on stdout
      },
      "nebula-sonnet": {
        "family": "nebula",
        "version": "sonnet-2026-07",
        "command": [...]
      }
    }

The harness invokes each ``command`` with a compact-JSON payload on stdin
(``separators=(",", ":")``, exactly like ``_invoke`` in
``model_matrix_benchmark.py``) and expects JSON on stdout.  Required reply
fields (model_matrix's full contract is the floor): ``task_success``,
``input_tokens``, ``output_tokens``, ``provider_cost_usd``.  Optional:
``infrastructure_cost_usd``, ``retrieval_cost_usd``, ``retry_cost_usd``,
``cost_usd`` (else the sum of the cost components), ``latency_ms``,
``retrievals``, ``tool_calls``, ``retries``, ``semantic_loss``,
``reconstruction`` (text the receiver produced; used by the harness-side
critical-fact-recall scoring) and ``critical_fact_recall`` (adapter-reported;
preferred over the harness-side score).

Payload contract (per exchange): ``protocol: "sage/0.2"``,
``benchmark: "compression_benchmark:phoenix_rfc"``, ``variant`` /
``variant_name``, ``turn`` / ``phase``, ``receiver_state`` (``"cold"`` =
fresh receiver with no prior state; ``"warm"`` = receiver prior established
from the shared-context phase, e.g. codebook/patterns ACKed), ``receiver_prior``
(ACKed shared context for warm, ``null`` for cold), ``decoder_configuration``
(one of the RFC's three modes), ``symbolic_examples`` (whether the model saw
symbolic-format examples; when true an ``examples`` list with a sample packet
+ its meaning is included), ``representation`` (the symbolic wire form:
the stage-2 reconstruction for plain variants, a deterministic symbolic
packet rendering for SAGE variants), ``wire_bytes``, ``model_facing_text``
(the text the model is asked to consume), ``content`` (the message/state the
sender conveyed), ``expected`` (the per-turn ground-truth answer key) and
``change_markers``.

Sealed mode (issue #22, stage 1 -- ``--sealed``, default OFF)
-------------------------------------------------------------
With ``--sealed`` the adapter boundary is SPLIT: the payload carries ONLY the
identity fields (``protocol``, ``benchmark``, ``variant``, ``variant_name``,
``turn``, ``phase``, ``receiver_state``, ``decoder_configuration``,
``wire_bytes``, ``symbolic_examples`` -- always ``false`` in sealed mode) plus
``task`` (a deterministic per-variant instruction: the state variants
v05/v06/v11/v12 ask for the current state --
``deployment_allowed``/``failed_tests``/``migration_approved``/``blocker`` --
plus what changed; the text variants ask for a summary of the latest update
plus what changed), ``model_facing_packet`` and ``allowed_decoder_metadata``
(``codebook_version`` from the adapter config or ``global:1``,
``receiver_state``, ``decoder_configuration``).  NEVER sent: ``content``,
``expected``, ``change_markers``, ``receiver_prior``, ``examples`` or any raw
source text -- the model runner cannot see evaluator-only knowledge.  The
adapter replies with a ``task_response`` text plus tokens/cost;
``task_success`` and ``critical_fact_recall`` are scored DETERMINISTICALLY by
the harness from that text (``cb.read_state`` + ``cb.evaluate_turn`` per-turn
ratios + ``cb.fidelity_critical``) -- adapter-reported scores are ignored in
sealed mode.  ``--sealed`` cannot be combined with ``--with-examples``
(example meanings are evaluator-side decoder knowledge).  Sealed artifacts
carry a top-level ``evaluation_boundary: "sealed"`` and per-row
``sealed: true`` + ``task_response``; default OFF keeps every artifact
byte-identical to the stage-3/4 shape.  In sealed mode the warm receiver
is established through the REAL SAGE lifecycle (issue #22, stage 4): for
each SAGE variant, before its warm exchanges, the shared-context turn
(``content_fn(0)`` -- ``SHARED_CONTEXT`` or the held-out
``ESTABLISHMENT_SHARED_CONTEXT``) is encoded with a pinned packet id and
DECODED with ``acknowledge=True`` (receiver "bob"), which COMMITS receiver
knowledge (known codes / known refs / current_state) into the knowledge
store -- verified before any warm turn is rendered -- and the warm
exchanges then encode with ``use_receiver_knowledge=True``, so the warm
rows' wire bytes ARE the primed lifecycle measurement.  On the CURRENT
fixture the primed warm wire bytes EQUAL the cold re-encode's (receiver
knowledge is decoder-side; the wire whitelist strips
``receiver_known_code_count``), so there is NO wire saving to claim here --
the honest claim is the primed lifecycle, not a wire delta, and the tests
assert that equality rather than hiding it.  Warm rows deliberately carry
no explicit ``primed`` row marker (the internal exchange flag is not
propagated to rows, keeping the sealed row shape additive by exactly
``mechanism_used``); sealed ``receiver_state: "warm"`` rows ARE these
lifecycle-primed re-encodes.  ``receiver_prior`` is never sent in sealed
mode (a leak field); the priming happens ONCE per variant before its warm
exchanges (fresh receiver state per variant/run: per-process scratch DB +
schema reset per variant).

Sealed mode, stage 2 (issue #22 section B mode 1 -- actual packet rendering):
for SAGE variants (v09-v12) in ``direct-symbolic`` mode the
``model_facing_packet`` is NO LONGER the stage-1 canonical-clause proxy: it
is a canonical compact-JSON rendering of the REAL codec packet for that
``(variant, turn)``, deterministically re-encoded through the codec exactly
like the stage-2 benchmark (``_render_sage_variant_packets`` mirrors
``cb._run_sage_variant``: schema reset, spec ``Settings``, codebook
registration from ``spec["codebook"]`` in order, pinned packet ids, the v10
pattern warm-up, per-turn encode+decode).  The re-encoded wire bytes equal
the benchmark's recorded ``wire_bytes`` for the same ``(variant, turn)``
(honesty gate), and the rendering round-trips: parsed back with
``Packet.model_validate`` and decoded by the real codec it yields the
benchmark's recorded reconstruction.  The rendering carries the packet
fields (atom codes/cv + literals, refs, base, delta ops, prov, and meta
FILTERED to the wire whitelist {state, revision, budget_exceeded,
memory_tier} -- the exact subset the wire codec exports, so the rendering
equals the real wire packet + the bindings legend; evaluator-side meta
fields like the strategy/codebook fingerprint/receiver knowledge never
leave the evaluator) plus a ``bindings`` legend mapping each atom's
``code:cv`` to its canonical clause (learned-pattern atoms map to the
pattern's expanded canonical), so a model can answer from codes + bindings
while the FULL codebook/pattern store stays evaluator-side.  Non-sealed
mode and sealed non-direct-symbolic modes keep the stage-1
representation/reconstruction selection byte-identical.

Sealed direct-symbolic RECONSTRUCTION-FIDELITY scope (stage-2 hardening,
stage-4 warm update): in sealed direct-symbolic mode the CHAINED/REFERENCE
variants are a reconstruction-fidelity signal, not a self-contained task
payload.  v11's rendering is ``base`` (a ``sage:sha256:`` state hash) +
``delta`` ops only -- the base state content lives evaluator-side behind
the hash -- and v10 turn 0's single pattern atom covers 1 of 5 clauses, so
a COLD sealed receiver cannot resolve the base-state/reference content: a
perfect echo of the packet is structurally bounded (e.g. ~0.70/0.15
task_success on v11 turns 1-2).  This is the real SAGE cold-receiver
behavior -- NOT a rendering defect (the rendering is faithful to the codec
packet and round-trips) -- and sealed COLD v11 / v10-turn-0 scores must be
read as reconstruction-fidelity signals.  The stage-4 lifecycle-primed
WARM rows are the real primed measurement: the warm receiver ACKed the
establishment through the real lifecycle before the warm exchanges (see
the stage-4 section above), so warm base-state/reference resolution is
anchored exactly as the codec's own primed lifecycle provides it.

Held-out mode (issue #22, stage 3 -- unseen conversations, ``--held-out``,
default OFF)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
``--held-out`` (requires ``--sealed``; a clean exit-2 error otherwise)
evaluates the sealed harness against a HELD-OUT scenario
(``scripts/heldout_scenario.py``): the codebook/pattern establishment phase
material is FROZEN before the held-out updates are revealed.  Three phases:

* ESTABLISHMENT -- a NEW project ("Orion": distinct names/facts) is
  transmitted once as the shared context.  This is the ONLY material the
  SAGE variants' FROZEN codebook is compiled from
  (``heldout_scenario.establishment_canonicals`` -- the sorted canonical
  clauses of ``ESTABLISHMENT_SHARED_CONTEXT`` alone).  3 of the 5
  establishment canonicals differ from the default Phoenix scenario; the
  other two are shared ('12' -- the bare number split out of "Python
  3.12." -- and 'database_migrations_must_be_reviewed_by_the_platform_team',
  the generic migration-review sentence kept verbatim for the fidelity
  checker); the held-out UPDATE canonicals are fully disjoint from
  Phoenix.
* FROZEN CODEBOOK -- the SAGE variants' codebook is pinned to the
  establishment canonicals BEFORE any held-out update is revealed.  The
  held-out updates (>= 8, covering every issue section-C content type:
  paraphrased concept / unseen value / new combination of known concepts /
  changed state / contradiction / negation / numeric constraint /
  delayed-relevance) are compiled but their canonicals are deliberately NOT
  in the frozen codebook (proven by the frozen-codebook-proof test).
* HELD-OUT UPDATES -- the updates are revealed and the six-turn sealed
  exchange loop runs exactly as in the standard scenario, but the scenario
  globals of the loaded benchmark module (``SHARED_CONTEXT`` / ``UPDATES`` /
  ``STATE_DICTS`` / ``CHANGE_MARKERS``) are patched from the held-out fixture
  BEFORE the spec builders / benchmark / scoring read them (they resolve the
  globals at call time), so ``run_benchmark``, the plain variants, the SAGE
  variants and the sealed scorer all operate on the held-out material.

SAGE variants run in BOTH explicitly-labeled codebook modes:

* ``oracle_codebook: true`` -- the ORACLE codebook (compiled from the
  establishment material AND all held-out updates, as ``cb._sage_specs()``
  does): the benchmark-recorded upper bound where the codebook was allowed to
  see everything.  Rows are the standard sealed rows against the patched
  scenario; their variant_name carries a `` [oracle]`` suffix.  The
  "allowed to see everything" narrative is exact for the CODEBOOK variants
  v09/v10 (their oracle codebook is the full clause set and the frozen one
  is a pure subset of it).  For v11/v12 it must NOT be read that way:
  oracle v11's codebook is ``[]`` (references + state deltas) and oracle
  v12's is the state-field KEYS, so the frozen-vs-oracle delta on v11/v12
  mixes codebook-kind with frozen-ness (the frozen re-encode gives v11/v12
  a text-clause codebook their oracle design never had).  The data is
  honest and deterministic; the labels keep the two modes from being
  merged.
* ``oracle_codebook: false`` -- the FROZEN establishment-only codebook:
  spec copies of the oracle SAGE specs with the ``codebook`` field replaced
  by the sorted establishment canonicals, deterministically re-encoded
  through the REAL codec (``_render_frozen_variant_packets``, mirroring
  ``_render_sage_variant_packets``: schema reset, codebook registration in
  order, pinned packet ids, v10 pattern warm-up).  Their wire bytes ARE the
  measurement -- no benchmark-recorded counterpart exists for the frozen
  codebook -- and they differ from the oracle rows' (the smaller frozen
  codebook inlines more literals).  Their variant_name carries a
  `` [frozen]`` suffix.

Every held-out row carries ``oracle_codebook: true|false`` (true for the
oracle SAGE rows, false for the frozen SAGE rows and the plain variants --
a plain variant has no codebook mode; the label is false), and the artifact
gains top-level keys ``dataset_split: "held_out"`` and ``oracle_codebook``
(a mapping of each evaluated SAGE variant to its modes,
``{"v09": ["frozen", "oracle"], ...}``).  ``--held-out`` cannot be combined
with ``--record-feedback`` (clean exit-2 error): feedback-loop semantics are
defined against the standard scenario; held-out feedback is a future
refinement.  Default OFF keeps every artifact byte-identical to the
stage-1/2 sealed shape (no ``dataset_split`` / ``oracle_codebook`` keys, no
mode suffixes).

Sealed mechanism attribution (issue #22, stage 4 -- default OFF)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Every sealed row carries a ``mechanism_used`` field naming the PRIMARY
compression mechanism of the turn's encode, derived deterministically from
the real encode, via the same re-encode machinery that renders the sealed
packets: the packet's own strategy/base/refs/atoms, plus the encode's
decisions list ONLY for the receiver-capability attribution
(``fallback_negotiated`` -- the sole decision-level signal consulted;
``"learned_pattern"`` is inferred from the codec's PATTERN-STORE state, an
active learned pattern for the coded atom's concept, not from a decision
record).  The values: ``"state_delta"`` (delta packet with a base),
``"reference"`` (reference packet with refs), ``"learned_pattern"`` (a
coded atom's concept has an active learned pattern), ``"codebook"`` (coded
atoms; codebook definitions used), ``"capability"`` (only when the
decisions record a receiver-capability negotiation --
``fallback_negotiated``), ``"literal"`` (all-literal packet, no compression
mechanism), or ``"none"`` (plain variants, which have no codec lifecycle).
The artifact gains a top-level ``mechanism_summary`` mapping each variant
to its per-mechanism counts across that variant's sealed rows (in held-out
mode the oracle and frozen rows of the same variant share one bucket; the
per-row ``mechanism_used`` values stay distinguishable on the rows).  This
is ADDITIVE JSON: no existing row field changes beyond the new key, and
default-OFF artifacts carry neither ``mechanism_used`` nor
``mechanism_summary``.

RFC field mapping (per result row)
----------------------------------
* receiver model        -> ``receiver_model`` (the config identity)
* model version         -> ``model_version`` (config ``version``)
* codebook version      -> ``codebook_version`` (config, default ``global:1``)
* decoder configuration -> ``decoder_configuration`` (one of
  ``direct symbolic`` / ``decoder-assisted`` / ``full natural-language
  expansion``, from ``--decoder-mode``)
* symbolic-format examples -> ``symbolic_examples`` (bool, from
  ``--with-examples``)
* cold vs warm           -> ``receiver_state``

Cold vs warm
------------
Every selected variant's six exchanges are run twice per adapter: once
``cold`` (``receiver_prior: null``) and once ``warm`` (prior = the ACKed
shared context).  Both rows are reported, plus warm-vs-cold deltas (wire
bytes, input tokens, cost, task accuracy, critical-fact recall).

Decoder modes (RFC "Model-facing evaluation modes")
---------------------------------------------------
* ``direct-symbolic`` (default): the model sees the compact representation;
  ``model_facing_text`` == ``representation``; no expansion tokens.
* ``decoder-assisted``: the harness expands the packet to model-facing text
  BEFORE sending (``model_facing_text`` == the stage-2 deterministic
  reconstruction) and ADDS the expansion tokens to the adapter-reported
  ``input_tokens`` (RFC "Prevent hidden decompression costs": decoding-step
  tokens are always counted; the reported input tokens are a conservative
  upper bound when the adapter already bills the expanded text).
* ``full-expansion``: the packet is reconstructed to ordinary language;
  the adapter reports the tokens it actually consumed.

>=2 model families gate
-----------------------
The config must cover at least 2 DISTINCT ``family`` values; a config with
<2 families is rejected with a clear error (RFC acceptance criterion 4 /
stage-3 "run the receiver task using at least two model families").

Public result format (RFC "Proposed public result format")
----------------------------------------------------------
The printed table and ``--output`` artifact use the RFC's six columns,
one row per (variant, receiver, cold/warm) combination, sorted
deterministically::

    | Variant | Wire bytes | Input tokens | Total cost | Task accuracy | Critical-fact recall |
    | --- | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |

Raw artifacts (``--output <dir>``) are written OUTSIDE the repository:
``model_eval_harness.json`` (per-exchange rows + table rows + deltas) and
``model_eval_harness.md``.  The scratch codec database lives at a
per-process-unique path ``~/.sage-bench/model_eval_harness-<pid>.db`` (the
pid suffix keeps concurrent harness processes on separate files) -- never
inside the output dir -- and is stable for the lifetime of the process (it is
never deleted while the module-level sqlalchemy engine may hold pooled
connections to it); it is removed at process exit.  The output dir contains
only the two artifacts.

Determinism: two runs produce byte-identical printed tables, ``.md``
artifacts and JSON artifacts except for the measured per-adapter-call
``latency_ms`` row values (real wall-clock measurements, deliberately
excluded from determinism comparisons); ``generated_at`` is pinned to the
benchmark's fixed timestamp.

Feedback loop (issue #16, stage 4 -- RFC "learned semantic shorthand"):
with ``--record-feedback`` (default OFF), after the exchanges the harness
records each selected SAGE variant's measured task success (the mean of the
adapter-reported ``task_success`` for that variant's rows) into the codec's
pattern store via ``PatternStore.record_feedback``, mirroring
``runtime.feedback`` semantics: ``task_success`` must be in ``[0, 1]``
(``ValueError``), an unknown ``packet_id`` raises ``KeyError``, and the
decisions come from the ``MessageAudit`` rows the real encodes created
(pinned packet ids per variant/turn, re-encoded deterministically into the
scratch database).  The feedback summary (patterns updated, ``task_utility``
and ``utility_score`` before/after per pattern) is ADDITIVE JSON -- a new
top-level ``feedback`` key in the artifact -- and never alters existing row
fields or the RFC table; wire bytes are byte-identical with or without the
flag (feedback is post-hoc DB bookkeeping, never touches encode).  Without
the flag the artifacts are byte-identical to the stage-3 shape.

``run_harness`` (the public API) refuses to run unless ``SAGE_DATABASE_URL``
is set to a writable scratch database path -- it never operates on the
ambient default database (``~/sage.db``); ``main()`` sets this up
automatically.  It also refuses when ``sage_plugin.db`` is already imported
with an engine bound to a different database than ``SAGE_DATABASE_URL`` (the
module-level engine cannot be rebound in this process).  ``--timeout`` must
be a positive finite number, an empty ``--variants`` value is an error, and
``family``/``version`` values are whitespace-stripped on load.
