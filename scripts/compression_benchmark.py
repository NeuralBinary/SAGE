"""Deterministic multi-turn semantic-context compression benchmark (issue #16, stage 2).

This benchmark measures how twelve context-compression strategies (the RFC
variants) carry a fixed multi-turn conversation, using only deterministic,
observable data -- no model, no provider, no random numbers. It is the
companion to stage 1's context-accounting instrumentation
(``sage_plugin.context_accounting``): the SAGE variants run the REAL
``SageCodec`` with ``context_accounting_enabled=True`` and surface the
per-exchange ``ContextReport`` fields (codebook/pattern setup, decoding
volume, reference-fetch volume, fallbacks) so hidden decompression costs are
visible.

Run it with no arguments to print the four summary tables to stdout:

    uv run --with '.[dev,mcp]' python scripts/compression_benchmark.py

Pass ``--out <dir>`` to additionally write deterministic JSON and CSV
artifacts (``compression_benchmark.json`` / ``compression_benchmark.csv``)
into ``<dir>``.

Scenario
--------
RFC "Phoenix" fixture, fully embedded below (no external files):

* Phase 1 -- shared context transmitted once before the first update.
* Phase 2 -- five updates that mutate a project state (blocked by failing
  integration tests -> failures fixed -> a database-migration failure ->
  migration approved -> ready for production deployment).  Each update also
  carries an embedded ground-truth state dictionary.
* Phase 3 -- after each update a downstream task is scored against the
  embedded ground-truth answer key: five QA questions (is deployment
  allowed; what blocks it; which team acts next; was the migration
  approved; what changed since the previous update), state reconstruction
  (four state fields), constraint compliance (two Phase-1 constraints), and
  action selection.

Because the ground truth is embedded, task-performance scoring is fully
deterministic: a rule-based reader (``read_state``) extracts the predicted
state from each variant's reconstruction text and the answers are compared
exactly against the ground-truth key.  The reader is documented as a
"perfect-reader oracle": it isolates representation quality from model
quality.

The twelve RFC variants
-----------------------
Each variant encodes the same scenario and is measured with the same
metrics.  Variants 1-8 are plain serialization/string operations; variants
9-12 run the real ``SageCodec``:

 1.  full natural-language context every turn   -- receiver keeps everything
 2.  latest-only message                        -- receiver keeps only the
                                                 most recent message
 3.  minified JSON                              -- full history as a compact
                                                 JSON array
 4.  MessagePack                                -- same content, msgpack wire
 5.  conventional state snapshots               -- a key/value state dict
                                                 replaced each turn
 6.  conventional state deltas                  -- base snapshot + JSON-Patch
                                                 style operations
 7.  LLM summaries                              -- DETERMINISTIC extractive
                                                 stub (sentence precision);
                                                 no provider is ever required
 8.  retrieval of relevant prior messages       -- deterministic
                                                 keyword/recency selector
 9.  SAGE codebooks only                        -- real codec, semantic
                                                 packets, patterns disabled
 10. SAGE codebooks + learned patterns          -- real codec; a pattern is
                                                 learned in a warm-up
                                                 exchange and activated
 11. SAGE references + state deltas             -- real codec; Phase 1 as a
                                                 reference, updates as
                                                 state deltas
 12. full SAGE with ACKed receiver knowledge    -- real codec; state dicts
                                                 encoded semantically and
                                                 decoded with
                                                 ``acknowledge=True`` so the
                                                 receiver's codebook
                                                 knowledge accumulates

Provider policy
---------------
The benchmark never invokes an external provider.  A provider is considered
configured when ``SAGE_BENCH_LLM_PROVIDER`` is a non-empty environment
variable.  Any variant whose ``requires_provider`` flag is set is skipped
cleanly when no provider is configured and reported as
"not run, no provider" (mirroring the adapter-skip convention of
``scripts/model_matrix_benchmark.py``: provider numbers are never
fabricated).  No built-in variant currently requires a provider: variant 7
uses the deterministic extractive stub, so all twelve rows run with zero
configuration.

Metrics
-------
Efficiency (per exchange and cumulative): wire bytes (canonical JSON and
MessagePack), stored bytes (state/reference stores), model-facing input
tokens (tokens of the transmitted representation rendered as JSON text),
model-facing output tokens (tokens of the reconstructed context the
receiver must read), encode/decode latency (measured with
``time.perf_counter``, rounded to ms -- the only non-deterministic columns),
reference-fetch volume (bytes/count), and a cumulative cost.  The cost model
is synthetic but deterministic and documented::

    cost_usd = wire_bytes_json * 0.0000005        # $0.50 / MB
             + model_output_tokens * 0.000002     # $2.00 / Mtok
             + reference_fetch_bytes * 0.0000002  # $0.20 / MB fetched

Task performance: QA accuracy (exact match on the five questions per turn),
state-reconstruction accuracy (four fields), constraint compliance (the two
Phase-1 constraints recoverable from the final reconstruction), action
accuracy (action derived from the reconstructed state), and task success
(the mean of those four).

Semantic fidelity -- per-fact-type preservation checks on the
reconstruction, each scored 0..1 and averaged:

* negation: per-turn stance of the "deployment allowed" fact (turns 1-4
  "not allowed", turn 5 "allowed").  Passes when the reconstruction
  expresses the expected stance ("ready for production deployment" /
  "deployment_allowed: true" for allowed; "blocked" / "not allowed" /
  "deployment_allowed: false" for not allowed).  A reconstruction that
  cannot express a stance (e.g. a message with no stance marker) fails.
* numeric: the numbers "three" (turn 1), "two" (turn 2), "one" (turn 3)
  must be recoverable from the corresponding turn's reconstruction.
* ownership: "the payment service is owned by the Commerce team" -- the
  final reconstruction must contain both "payment service" and
  "commerce team".
* temporal ordering: "blocked" (turn 1) must appear before "ready for
  production deployment" (turn 5) in the final reconstruction.
* changed-value: the final reconstruction must support recovering that the
  failing-test count changed (contains a "three"/3 and a "one"/1 or
  "two").
* contradiction: the migration-failure -> migration-approved transition
  must be recoverable ("migration" and "failure" and "approved" all
  present).
* critical-fact recall: the two Phase-1 constraints ("production
  deployments require all integration tests to pass"; "database migrations
  must be reviewed by the platform team") must survive into the final
  reconstruction.

All checks run on lowercase text with underscores normalized to spaces.

Amortization (vs the full-context baseline, variant 1): setup cost
(codebook + pattern setup bytes/tokens, 0 for plain variants), saving per
use (baseline total minus variant total, divided by the 6 conversation
turns), and break-even = ``ceil(setup_cost / max(saving_per_use, 1))``.
When the saving per use is non-positive the denominator clamps to 1 and the
break-even equals the setup cost -- interpret that as "does not break even";
compare with the saving column.

Determinism
-----------
* No RNG, no wall-clock time in the output; artifact metadata uses the
  fixed timestamp ``2026-08-01T00:00:00+00:00``.
* SAGE packet ids are pinned to sha256-derived ids per (variant, turn); the
  printed tables and artifacts never contain packet ids.
* The SAGE codec uses a fixed ``Provenance``, ``use_cache=False``,
  ``record_learning=False``, ``auto_learn=False`` (except the variant-10
  pattern warm-up), and an isolated SQLite database whose schema is reset
  per variant.  ``SAGE_DATABASE_URL`` must be set before the first
  ``sage_plugin`` import; the standalone entry point does this in
  ``main()`` before any lazy import, and deletes its scratch database on
  exit.
* Latency columns are measured and rounded to milliseconds; two runs'
  artifacts are byte-identical once the ``*_latency_ms`` fields are
  dropped.
